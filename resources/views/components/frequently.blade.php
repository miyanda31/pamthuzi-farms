                        <p>Many people sign up for affiliate programs with the hopes of making some
                            serious money. They advertise a few places and then wait for the money to
                            start pouring in. When it doesn’t, they blame it on the program and quit.

                        <p>I am convinced the only way to make money online is to have a consistent
                            Advertising plan. A plan you are willing to work hard on and commit to for a
                            selected period of time. When making this plan, you need to do two things.
                            First, you should pick a few affiliate programs that are of interest to you.
                            Second, you need to decide how long you want to work these programs. Once
                            you decide on a time period (I recommend 6 months to a year), you must make
                            a promise to yourself that you will not stop advertising until that</p>
